## .exe file is inside dist folder.

This is an imitation of a screen time application but solely for desktop users. Now I'm nowhere near professional when it comes to
programming, especially Python and Java which both seem to be the most popular choices for this type of application because of their
plentiful libraries.

I have little-to-no experiences yet, so the executable lacks a lot of features that a screen time counter would usually have.
